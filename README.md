🤯 The main struggle I had with this challenge was having some items on the page that are perfectly aligned i've successed to do that with adding a max-width on these elements.

• What i've learnt so far is :

   • How to make animations on hover on an object, transition and transform.. 
   • Creating a clean layout, separated header and main and footer.
   • making two columns of two divs with the property: ( exemple  => columns : 2 ) 

I added some hover features:

    👨‍🔬 Custom hover on the header icon gives an animation .
    👻 Custom hover cards gives a nice looking shadows .

🕵 Happy to hear any feedback or advice!
